      description: >
        "By default calibre creates an SVG based cover that scales with the screen size of the reader used to view it. Previosuly this scaling
        was limited to preserve the aspect ratio of the image. This would often result in white borders at the sides or top and bottom of the image.
        No, by default, calibre will setup the cover to not preserve aspect ratio, doing away with the white borders. The downside is that if the
        aspect ratio of the cover is very different from the reader, it will look distorted. The old behavior can be restored via
