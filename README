Library implementing a reverse engineered protocol to communicate with the Sony Reader PRS-500. 

Requirements:
1) Python >= 2.5
2) PyUSB >= 0.3.4 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/)

Usage:
At the moment all that it can do is a simple ls command. Add the following to /etc/udev/rules.d/90-local.rules
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="029b", SYSFS{idVendor}=="054c", MODE="660", GROUP="plugdev"
and run udevstart to enable access to the reader for non-root users. You may have to adjust the GROUP and the location of the
rules file to suit your distribution.
