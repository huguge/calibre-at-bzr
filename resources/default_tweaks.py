# Possible values are:
# next - Next available number
# const - Assign the number 1 always

# The algorithm used to copy author to author_sort
# Possible values are:
#  invert: use "fn ln" -> "ln, fn" (the original algorithm)
#  copy  : copy author to author_sort without modification
#  comma : use 'copy' if there is a ',' in the name, otherwise use 'invert'
author_sort_copy_method = 'invert'


# Set whether boolean custom columns are two- or three-valued.
#  Two-values for true booleans
#  three-values for yes/no/unknown
# Set to 'yes' for three-values, 'no' for two-values

# Provide a set of columns to be sorted on when calibre starts
#  The argument is None if saved sort history is to be used
#  otherwise it is a list of column,order pairs. Column is the
#  lookup/search name, found using the tooltip for the column
#  Order is 0 for ascending, 1 for descending
# For example, set it to [('authors',0),('title',0)] to sort by
# title within authors.

# Format to be used for publication date
#  A string controlling how the publication date is displayed in the GUI
#  d    the day as number without a leading zero (1 to 31)
#  dd    the day as number with a leading zero (01 to 31)
#  ddd    the abbreviated localized day name (e.g. 'Mon' to 'Sun').
#  dddd    the long localized day name (e.g. 'Monday' to 'Qt::Sunday').
#  M    the month as number without a leading zero (1-12)
#  MM    the month as number with a leading zero (01-12)
#  MMM    the abbreviated localized month name (e.g. 'Jan' to 'Dec').
#  MMMM    the long localized month name (e.g. 'January' to 'December').
#  yy    the year as two digit number (00-99)
#  yyyy    the year as four digit number
#  For example, given the date of 9 Jan 2010, the following formats show
#  MMM yyyy ==> Jan 2010    yyyy ==> 2010       dd MMM yyyy ==> 09 Jan 2010

# Control title and series sorting in the library view.
# If set to 'library_order', Leading articles such as The and A will be ignored.
# If set to 'strictly_alphabetic', the titles will be sorted without processing
# For example, with library_order, The Client will sort under 'C'. With
# strictly_alphabetic, the book will sort under 'T'.
# This flag affects Calibre's library display. It has no effect on devices. In
# addition, titles for books added before changing the flag will retain their
# order until the title is edited. Double-clicking on a title and hitting return
# without changing anything is sufficient to change the sort.

# be used as the Genre
