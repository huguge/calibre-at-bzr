Demonstration of `txt2lrf`
==========================

`txt2lrf` provides a convenient way to create LRF files with good formatting. 
`txt2lrf` recognizes a simple markup language called *markdown*.

The idea is to provide a lightweight markup that can be used to create
TXT files that can be read by themselves or automatically converted to LRF.
