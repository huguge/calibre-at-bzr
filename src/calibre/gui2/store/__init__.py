class StorePlugin(object): # {{{
    '''
    A plugin representing an online ebook repository (store). The store can
    be a comercial store that sells ebooks or a source of free downloadable
    ebooks.

    Note that this class is the base class for these plugins, however, to
    integrate the plugin with calibre's plugin system, you have to make a
    wrapper class that references the actual plugin. See the
    :mod:`calibre.customize.builtins` module for examples.

    If two :class:`StorePlugin` objects have the same name, the one with higher
    priority takes precedence.
    
    Sub-classes must implement :meth:`open`, and :meth:`search`.
    
    Regarding :meth:`open`. Most stores only make themselves available
    though a web site thus most store plugins will open using
    :class:`calibre.gui2.store.web_store_dialog.WebStoreDialog`. This will
    open a modal window and display the store website in a QWebView.
    
    Sub-classes should implement and use the :meth:`genesis` if they require
    plugin specific initialization. They should not override or otherwise
    reimplement :meth:`__init__`.
    
    Once initialized, this plugin has access to the main calibre GUI via the
    :attr:`gui` member. You can access other plugins by name, for example::

        self.gui.istores['Amazon Kindle']
    '''

    def __init__(self, gui, name):
        self.gui = gui
        self.name = name
        self.base_plugin = None
    
    def open(self, gui, parent=None, detail_item=None, external=False):
        '''
        Open the store.
        
        :param gui: The main GUI. This will be used to have the job
        system start downloading an item from the store.
        
        :param parent: The parent of the store dialog. This is used
        to create modal dialogs.
        
        :param detail_item: A plugin specific reference to an item
        in the store that the user should be shown.
        
        :param external: When False open an internal dialog with the
        store. When True open the users default browser to the store's
        web site. :param:`detail_item` should still be respected when external
        is True.
        '''
        raise NotImplementedError()
    
    def search(self, query, max_results=10, timeout=60):
        '''
        Searches the store for items matching query. This should
        return items as a generator.
        
        Don't be lazy with the search! Load as much data as possible in the
        :class:`calibre.gui2.store.search_result.SearchResult` object. If you have to parse
        multiple pages to get all of the data then do so. However, if data (such as cover_url)
        isn't available because the store does not display cover images then it's okay to
        ignore it.
        
        :param query: The string query search with.
        :param max_results: The maximum number of results to return.
        :param timeout: The maximum amount of time in seconds to spend download the search results.
        
        :return: :class:`calibre.gui2.store.search_result.SearchResult` objects
        item_data is plugin specific and is used in :meth:`open` to open to a specifc place in the store.

        settings. This is used by plugins to get the saved
        settings and apply when necessary.
        
        :return: A dictionary filled with the settings used
        by this plugin.
