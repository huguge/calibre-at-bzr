"Specify renaming rules for sony collections. This tweak is only applicable "
"if\n"
"metadata management is set to automatic. Collections on Sonys are named\n"
"depending upon whether the field is standard or custom. A collection "
"derived\n"
"from a standard field is named for the value in that field. For example, if\n"
"the standard 'series' column contains the value 'Darkover', then the\n"

"will\n"
"have the name of the field added to the value. For example, if a custom "
"series\n"
"column named 'My Series' contains the name 'Darkover', then the collection\n"
"will by default be named 'Darkover (My Series)'. For purposes of this\n"
"documentation, 'Darkover' is called the value and 'My Series' is called the\n"
"category. If two books have fields that generate the same collection name,\n"
"then both books will be in that collection.\n"
"This set of tweaks lets you specify for a standard or custom field how\n"

"standard field, for example 'Foo (Tag)' instead of the 'Foo'. You can also "

"appear in collections named 'some_value (Series)', thereby merging all of "
"the\n"
"fields into one set of collections.\n"
"There are two related tweaks. The first determines the category name to use\n"
"for a metadata field.  The second is a template, used to determines how the\n"
"value and category are combined to create the collection name.\n"
"The syntax of the first tweak, sony_collection_renaming_rules, is:\n"
"{'field_lookup_name':'category_name_to_use', 'lookup_name':'name', ...}\n"
"The second tweak, sony_collection_name_template, is a template. It uses the\n"
"same template language as plugboards and save templates. This tweak "
"controls\n"
"how the value and category are combined together to make the collection "

"The only two fields available are {category} and {value}. The {value} field "

"never empty. The {category} field can be empty. The default is to put the\n"
"value first, then the category enclosed in parentheses, it is isn't empty:\n"
"'{value} {category:|(|)}'\n"
"Examples: The first three examples assume that the second tweak\n"
"has not been changed.\n"
"1: I want three series columns to be merged into one set of collections. "
"The\n"
"column lookup names are 'series', '#series_1' and '#series_2'. I want "
"nothing\n"
"in the parenthesis. The value to use in the tweak value would be:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'', '#series_1':'', "
"'#series_2':''}\n"
"2: I want the word '(Series)' to appear on collections made from series, "
"and\n"
"the word '(Tag)' to appear on collections made from tags. Use:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}\n"
"3: I want 'series' and '#myseries' to be merged, and for the collection "
"name\n"
"to have '(Series)' appended. The renaming rule is:\n"
"sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', '#myseries':'Series'}\n"
"4: Same as example 2, but instead of having the category name in "

"and appended to the value, I want it prepended and separated by a colon, "
"such\n"
"as in Series: Darkover. I must change the template used to format the "
