        <h2 id="Whatdevicesdoeslibprs500support">What devices does libprs500 support?</h2>
        <p>
            At the moment libprs500 has full support for the SONY PRS500 and PRS505. However, using the "save to disk" function you can use it with any ebook reader that exports itself as a USB disk.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Whatformatsdoeslibprs500readmetadatafrom">What formats does libprs500 read metadata from?</h2>

            libprs500 reads metadata from the following formats: LRF, PDF, LIT, RTF, OPF, MOBI, PRC, EPUB.
            In addition it can write metadata to: LRF, RTF, OPF
        </p>
        <h2 id="Whatformatsdoeslibprs500supportconversiontofrom">What formats does libprs500 support conversion to/from?</h2>
        <p>
            libprs500 supports the conversion of the following formats to LRF: HTML, LIT, MOBI, PRC, EPUB, RTF, TXT, PDF and LRS. It also supports the conversion of LRF to LRS and HTML(upcoming). Note that libprs500 does not support the conversion of DRMed ebooks.
        </p>
        <h2 id="WhatarethebestformatstoconverttoLRF">What are the best formats to convert to LRF?</h2>
        <p>
            In order of decreasing preference: LIT, MOBI, HTML, PRC, RTF, TXT, PDF
        </p>
        <h2 id="WhydoesthePDFconversionlosesomeimages">Why does the PDF conversion lose some images?</h2>
        <p>
            The PDF conversion tries to extract the text and images from the PDF file and convert them to and HTML based ebook. Some PDF files have images in a format that cannot be extracted (vector images).
        </p>
        <h2 id="Wherearethebookfilesstored">Where are the book files stored?</h2>
        <p>
            When you import books into the library, they are stored in a database. The database location can be found out by clicking the configuration button (The button with the icon of a hammer next to the search bar).
        </p>
        <h2 id="CanIsavemybookstothedisk">Can I save my books to the disk?</h2>
        <p>
            You can save your books to the disk by selecting the books and clicking the "Save to disk" button. Your books will be saved in nicely organized folders.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Iusedlibprs500totransfersomebookstomyreaderandnowtheSONYsoftwarehangseverytimeIconnectthereader">I used libprs500 to transfer some books to my reader, and now the SONY software hangs every time I connect the reader?</h2>
        <p>
            You should not use both libprs500 and Connect to transfer books to the reader. You can fix this problem by:
        </p>
        <ul><li>Removing any storage cards from your reader.
            </li><li>Deleting the file media.xml from the reader's main memory using windows explorer (search for the file to find all locations where it is present). Note that by doing this you will lose all your collections, bookmarks, history etc.
            </li><li>Unplugging the reader and waiting till the list of books shows up again
            </li><li>Re-connecting the reader and starting the SONY software
            </li></ul><h2 id="NoimagesintheLRFfileafterconversionfromHTML">No images in the LRF file after conversion from HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            If you use the GUI to convert an HTML file, you have to create a zip file with the HTML file and any images it references and then convert that ZIP file to LRF.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Iwantsomefeatureaddedtolibprs500.WhatcanIdo">I want some feature added to libprs500. What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
            You have two choices:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a patch by hacking on libprs500 and send it to me for review and inclusion. See
                <a class="wiki" href="http://libprs500.kovidgoyal.net/wiki/Development">Development</a>.
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://libprs500.kovidgoyal.net/newticket">Open a ticket</a> (you have to register and login first) and hopefully I will find the time to implement your feature.

        </ol>

        <h2 id="HowdoIusesomeoftheadvancedfeaturesoftheconversiontools">How do I use some of the advanced features of the conversion tools?</h2>
        <p>
            You can get help on any individual feature of the converters by mousing over it in the GUI or running html2lrf --help at a terminal. A good place to start is to look at the following demo files that demonstrate some of the advanced features:
