        <p>
            The Graphical User Interface <i>(GUI)</i> provides access to all
            library management and ebook format conversion features. The interface
            is divided into various sections:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#actions">Actions</a></li>
            <li><a href="#catalogs">Catalogs</a></li>

        <div><img src="images/actions.png" alt="The Actions toolbar"/></div>
        <p>
            The actions toolbar provides convenient shortcuts to commonly used actions.
            Most of the action buttons have little arrows next to them. By clicking the arrows,
            you can perform slight variations on the defult action.

            Add books
        </h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Add books</span> action has three variations, accessed by the
            arrow next to the button.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Add books from a single directory</b>: Opens a file chooser dialog and allows you to
                specify which books in a directory should be added. This action is <i>context sensitive</i>, i.e.
                it depends on which <a href="#catalogs">catalog</a> you have selected. If you have selected the
                library, books will be added to the library. If you have selected the ebook reader device, the books
                will be uploaded to the device.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Add books recursively (One book per directory)</b>: Allows you to choose a directory. The directory and
                all its sub-directories are scanned recursively and any ebooks found are added to the library. The algorithm
                assumes that each directory contains a single book. All ebook files in a directory are assumed to be the same book
                in different formats. This action is the inverse of the <a href="#save_to_disk_multiple">Save to disk</a> action,
                i.e. you can Save to disk, delete the books and re-add them with no lost information (except Date).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Add books recursively (Multiple books per directory)</b>: Allows you to choose a directory. The directory and
                all its sub-directories are scanned recursively and any ebooks found are added to the library. The algorithm
                assumes that each directory contains many books. All ebook files with the same name in a directory are assumed to be
                the same book in different formats. This action is the inverse of the
                <a href="#save_to_disk_single">Save to disk in a single directory</a> action,
                i.e. you can Save to disk, delete the books and re-add them with no lost information (except Date).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Add books</span> action can read metadata from the following ebook formats:
            <code>LRF, EPUB, LIT, MOBI, RTF, PDF, PRC, HTML</code>. In addition it tries to guess metadata from the filename.
            See <a href="#config_filename_metadata">Configuration</a> section, to learn how to configure this.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a new format to an existing book, use the <a href="#edit_meta_information">Edit meta information</a> action.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsectionHeading" id="remove_books"><img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/remove_books.png" alt="Remove books" />
            Remove books </h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Remove books</span> action deletes books permanently, so use it with care.
            It is <i>context sensitive</i>,
            i.e. it depends on which <a href="#catalogs">catalog</a> you have selected. If you have selected the
            library, books will be removed from the library. If you have selected the ebook reader device, the books
            will be removed from the device. To remove only a particular format for a given book use the
            <a href="#edit_meta_information">Edit meta information</a> action.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsectionHeading" id="edit_meta_information">
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/edit_meta_information.png" alt="Edit meta information" />
            Edit meta information
        </h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Edit meta information</span> action has two variations, accessed by the
            arrow next to the button.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Edit metadata individually</b>: This allows you to edit the metadata of books one-by-one, with the option
                of fetching metadata, including covers from the internet. It also allows you to add/remove particular
                ebook formats from a book. For more detail see <a href="metadata.html">Editing metadata</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Edit metadata in bulk</b>: This allows you to edit common metadata fields for large numbers of books simulataneously. It
                operates on all the books you have selected in the <a href="#library">Library view</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subsectionHeading" id="send_to_device">
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/send_to_device.png" alt="Send to device" />
            Send to device
        </h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Send to device</span> action has two variations, accessed by the
            arrow next to the button.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Send to main memory</b>: The selected books are transferred to the main memory of the ebook reader.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Send to card</b>: The selected books are transferred to the storage card on the ebook reader.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subsectionHeading" id="save_to_disk">
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/save_to_disk.png" alt="Save to disk" />
            Save to disk
        </h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Save to disk</span> action has two variations, accessed by the
            arrow next to the button.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li id="save_to_disk_multiple">
                <b>Save to disk</b>: This will save the selected books to disk organized in directories. The directory
                structure looks like:
                <pre>
Author
    Title
        Book Files
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li id="save_to_disk_single">
                <b>Save to disk in a single directory</b>: The selected books are saved to disk in a single directory.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All available formats as well as metadata is stored to disk for each selected book. Metadata is stored in an OPF file.
            Saved books can be re-imported to the library without any loss of information by using the <a href="#add_books">Add books</a>
            action.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsectionHeading" id="fetch_news">
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/fetch_news.png" alt="Fetch news" />
            Fetch news
        </h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Fetch news</span> action downloads news from various predefined
            websites and converts it into an ebook that can be read on your ebook reader. Normally, the newly
            created ebook is added to your ebook library, but if an ebook reader is connected at the time
            the download finishes, the news is uploaded to the reader directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Fetch news</span> uses simple profiles (10-15 lines of code) for each news
            site. To learn how to create profiles for your own news sources, see
            <a href="news.html">creating custom news profiles</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsectionHeading" id="convert_ebooks">
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/convert_ebooks.png" alt="Convert E-books" />
            Convert E-books
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ebooks can be converted from a number of formats into the LRF format (for the SONY Reader). Note that ebooks you purchase
            will typically have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management</a>
            <i>(DRM)</i>. libprs500 will not convert these ebooks. For many DRM formats, it is easy to remove the DRM, but as this
            is illegal, you have to find tools to liberate your books yourself and then use libprs500 to convert them.
        </p>
        <p>
            For most people, conversion should be a simple 1-click affair. But if you want to learn more about the
            conversion process, see <a href="conversion.html">E-book conversion</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">Convert E-books</span> action has three variations, accessed by the
            arrow next to the button.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Convert individually</b>: This will allow you to specify conversion options to customize the
                conversion of each selected ebook.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bulk convert</b>: This allows you to specify options only once to convert a number of ebooks in bulk.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Set conversion defaults</b>: Allows you to set the default settings for future conversions.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3 class="subsectionHeading" id="view">
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/view.png" alt="View" />
            View
        </h3>
        <p>
            The <span class="action">View</span> action displays the book in an ebook viewer program. libprs500 has a builtin
            viewer for the LRF format. For other formats it uses the default operating system application. If a book has more than
            one format, you can view a particular format by clicking the arrow next to the View button.
