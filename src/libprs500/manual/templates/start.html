            <b>${app}</b> is an e-book library manager. It can view, convert and catalog e-books
            in most of the major e-book formats. It can also talk to a few e-book reader devices. It can
            go out to the internet and fetch metadata for your books. It can download newspapers and convert
            them into e-books for convenient reading. It is cross platform, running on Linux, Windows and OS X.
        </p>
        <p>
            So you've just started ${app}. What do you do now? Well, before ${app} can do anything with your
            ebooks, it first has to know about them. So drag and drop a few ebook files into ${app}, or click
            the "Add books" button and browse for the ebooks you want to work with. Once you've added the books,
            they will show up in the main view looking something like this:<br/>
            <img src="images/added_books.png" alt="Added books"/><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've admired the list of books you just added to your heart's content, you'll probably want to read on. 
            In order to do that you'll have to convert the book to a format your reader understands. For the SONY
            Reader that's the LRF format. Conversion is a breeze, just select the book you want to convert, and
            click the "Convert E-book" button. Ignore all the options for now and just click "OK". The little hourglass
            in the bottom right corner will start spinning. Once it's finished spinning, your converted book is ready.
            Click to "View" button to read the book. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now if you want to read the book on your reader, just connect it to the computer, wait till
            ${app} detects it (10-20secs) and then click the "Send to device" button. Once the hourglass stops
            spinning again, disconnect your reader and read away!
