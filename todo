* Refactor web.fetch.simple to use per connection timeouts via the timeout kwarg for mechanize.open

* Refactor IPC code to use communication logic from multiprocessing

* Rationalize books table. Add a pubdate column, remove the uri column (and associated support in add_books) and  convert series_index to a float.

* Replace single application stuff with Listener from multiprocessing

* Refactor add books to use a separate process named calibre-worker-add
  - Dont use the process for adding a single book
  - Use a process pool for speed or multiple process for stability (20 per process?)
